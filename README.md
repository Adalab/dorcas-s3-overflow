# Sprint 3: OVERflow
We are OVERflow team, composed by Olatz, Valeria, Esther and Raquel.

This is our third project in Adalab on which we have been working with the code of our classmates' group called "Tarjetas Martirio". The purpose of this project is to transform the code from the second sprint, made with Javascript Vanilla, to React. 

The main goal of this project has been learning how to work with code that was made by others. It is one of the most efective ways to be conscious about the importance of doing a good comprehensive code.

We have been working to reach a milestone every week.

- First two days:

  >  In the first two days we organized the different roles we would have (planning, learning, communication and team-building). We created a Trello and a Slack group to be conected with our team mates. During these days we used the the group's repository that did the original project.

- First week:

  >  During the first week we created our own repository and with it, the first version of the project with React. We modified JavaScript ES5 to ES6 and started defining the web components.

- Second week:

  >  We included the state and events on React, understanding React's architecture. We worked on the form, getting the information from the form and writing it in the card preview.

- Third week:

  > We kept working on the form. We implemented lifting to move the information between the different components. We continued working with the events and the states of React.

- Fourth week:

  >  We did the local storage of the project and we did the single page application using React Router. We finished the skills of the form.

- Fifth week:

  > We cleaned the code, checked that all the parts of the projects were working good and prepared the final presentation.
