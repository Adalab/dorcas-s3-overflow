# Sprint 3: OVERflow
We are the OVERflow team, composed by Olatz, Valeria, Esther and Raquel.

This is our third project in Adalab. On this project we have been working with the code of our classmates. The objective of this project is to transform the project of the second sprint, made with Javascript Vanilla, to React. 
The main objective of this project has been to learn to work with code that was made by others. It is one of the most efective ways to realize about the importance of doing a good code.

We have been working to reach a milestone every week.

- First two days:

  >  In the first two days we organized the different roles of each of us and we created a Trello and an Slack group to be conected with our colleges. The first days we used the original repository of the group that did the original project.

- First week:

  >  During the first week we created the first version of our project with React. We refactorized the code with ES6, we defined the structure of the components with React and we wrote the props.

  - Second week:

  >  We included the states and events of React. We worked on the form, getting the information from the form and writing it in the preview of the card.

  - Third week:

  > We worked on the form. We implemented the lifting to move the information between the different components. We continued working with the events and the states of React.

    - Fourth week:

  >  We did the local storage of the  project and we did the single page application. We finished  the skills of the form.


    - Fifth week:

  > We cleaned the code and prepare the final presentation.
