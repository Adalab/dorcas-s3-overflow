# Sprint 3: OVERflow
We are the OVERflow team, composed by Olatz, Valeria, Esther and Raquel.

This is our third project in Adalab. On this project we have been working with the code of our classmates. The objective of this project is to transform the project of the second sprint, made with Javascript Vanilla, to React. 
The main objective of this project has been to learn to work with code that was made by others. It is one of the most efective ways to realize about the importance of doing a good code.

We have been working to reach a milestone every week.
